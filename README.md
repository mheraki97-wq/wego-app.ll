# WeGo Android App

This is a minimal Android Studio project named **WeGo**. Replace `app/src/main/assets/content.txt` with your content file (the file you uploaded) to display it inside the app.

Build with Android Studio (recommended) or use command line Gradle to assemble an APK.

Note: The layout uses ConstraintLayout. Android Studio will usually add the required dependency automatically. If not, add:

implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4'
